# Sample Geb Spock Gradle project for bakir.ch

## How to run

```

```

## Why this project

I learned Spock and Geb framework through [Konstantinos Kapelonis](https://github.com/kkapelon) book [Java Testing with 
Spock at Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/java-testing-with-spock), through 
the [MEAP books category](https://www.manning.com/meap-program) that I warmly recommend. It allowed me to put in 
practice in the java world the principles I learned from professors 
[Armando Fox](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/fox.html) and 
[David Patterson](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/patterson.html) class and book 
[Engineering Long-lasting Software](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Long-Lasting-Software-Approach-Computing/dp/0984881212). 
The consequence was a jump in productivity and happiness.

This project is to help me get back to using this approach on a daily basis, after few years of loss of practice.

I am applying it on my personal [httsp://bakir.ch/](https://bakir.ch/) that is completely outdated and needs refactoring.
